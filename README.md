# Step 1
## Task 1.1
### Main Challenge(s)
- The use of 'this' keyword is not achievable with arrow function when using ES6. Throws error that variable is 'Undefined'


# Step 2
## Task 2.2
### Why we created Prototype first and not place methods directly in the counter instances
- We created the Prototype to serve as a template with which we can make us of any time without polluting our code base by making different methods for different counter instance. This makes our code DRY.
- Also, I believe using the prototype as saves memory space and increases efficiency.
